WTG Portal Manager assists us in managing related content for a product, service or event. 

== Description ==

Manage related content for a product or service in one place then offer it to visitors...in one place.
The job of this plugin is to pull related content of all types (even a WP menu) into one area for both visitors and administrators.
Everyone should have a better experience finding, updating, adding and removing information.

The goal is a time saving tool that applies the same uniformal designs and standards to each portal with ease.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does portal does not display my chosen custom sidebar? =
Your theme may not support dynamic sidebars. The theme author may need to add the dynamic_sidebar() function
to the sidebar.php file in your themes folder. See more information here: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/dynamic_sidebar

= Can I display multiple custom/dynamic sidebars in one portal? = 
Yes - it is possible but I may need to add support for your theme. It depends on the custom ID values being passed
to the dynamic_sidebar() function. Adding support for your theme will not take long at all so please drop a comment in the plugins
forum. 

= As a WebTechGlobal subscriber can I get higher priority support for this plugin? =
Yes - subscribers are put ahead of my Free Workflow and will not only result in a quicker response for support
but requests for new features are marked with higher priority.

= Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me? =
Yes - you can pay to improve the plugin to suit your needs. However many improvements will be done free.
Please post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable
within my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks
priority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.

= Did WTG Portal Manager change one of my posts sidebars that I already set manually? =
I added this FAQ while creating the plugin because I'm allowing it to force a change to sidebar
that may have been done manually. Some users will want this but I'm ready to work with the users
who want something else. If you selected a special sidebar for your post/page manually on the Edit Post
screen. You may find that it is changed by WTG Portal Manager if you then assign that post or page to
a portal with a different main sidebar set. This scenario would indicate that you want/need the post to 
display widgets from two different sidebars. There may be a solution so please raise your situation on
the plugins forums.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the WTG Portal Manager plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if you need any recent changes. There is nothing wrong with skipping versions if changes do not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.
